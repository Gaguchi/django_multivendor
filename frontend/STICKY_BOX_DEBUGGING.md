# StickyBox Debugging Analysis

## Problem Description

The `react-sticky-box` is not working correctly in the Shop page layout. The sidebar should stick as the user scrolls, but instead it's scrolling normally with the page content.

## Console Log Analysis

From the debugging logs, we can see:

- `sidebarTop` is showing negative values like `-1542px` when scrolling
- This indicates the sidebar is moving UP with the scroll, not staying fixed
- The StickyBox mode changes are not being triggered

## Root Cause Analysis

### Bootstrap Grid + StickyBox Compatibility Issue

The issue is likely related to how `react-sticky-box` calculates its container context within Bootstrap's CSS Grid/Flexbox layout.

**Key Issues:**

1. **Container Height**: Bootstrap `.row` and `.col-*` elements don't have explicit height constraints
2. **Scroll Context**: StickyBox needs a clear scroll container to calculate sticky positioning
3. **Flex Layout**: Bootstrap's flex layout might interfere with StickyBox's positioning calculations

## Solutions to Try

### Solution 1: Explicit Container Heights ✅ IMPLEMENTED

```jsx
<div className="row d-none d-lg-flex" style={{ minHeight: "100vh" }}>
  <div className="col-lg-3" ref={sidebarColumnRef}>
    <StickyBox offsetTop={20} offsetBottom={20} bottom={false}>
      <Sidebar />
    </StickyBox>
  </div>
  <div className="col-lg-9" style={{ minHeight: "100vh" }}>
    <ProductGrid />
  </div>
</div>
```

### Solution 2: Alternative Layout Structure

If Bootstrap compatibility continues to be an issue, consider:

```jsx
<div style={{ display: "flex", minHeight: "100vh" }}>
  <div style={{ width: "25%", flexShrink: 0 }}>
    <StickyBox>
      <Sidebar />
    </StickyBox>
  </div>
  <div style={{ width: "75%", flex: 1 }}>
    <ProductGrid />
  </div>
</div>
```

### Solution 3: CSS-Only Sticky (Fallback)

```css
.sidebar-sticky {
  position: sticky;
  top: 20px;
  max-height: calc(100vh - 40px);
  overflow-y: auto;
}
```

## Debug Steps

1. ✅ Added `onChangeMode` callback to StickyBox
2. ✅ Added explicit container heights
3. ⏳ Test scroll behavior with infinite loading
4. ⏳ Verify sticky mode changes in console
5. ⏳ Check if container structure affects calculation

## Expected Behavior

- Sidebar should stick to top with 20px offset when scrolling
- Should work seamlessly with infinite scroll product loading
- StickyBox mode should change from 'relative' to 'fixed' during scroll

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/pages/Shop.jsx` - Updated container structure and StickyBox config
