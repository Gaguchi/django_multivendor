# Filter Button Fix Test

## Issue Fixed

The Sidebar component had "Clear" buttons that were missing `type="button"` attributes, causing them to behave as form submit buttons and trigger page reloads when clicked.

## Changes Made

Added `type="button"` to all Clear buttons in the Sidebar component:

1. **Categories Clear button** - Line ~258
2. **Brands Clear button** - Line ~327
3. **Price Clear button** - Line ~388
4. **Clear All Filters button** - Line ~235

## Test Instructions

1. Navigate to the Shop page
2. Apply some filters (categories, brands, or price range)
3. Click any of the "Clear" buttons
4. Verify that:
   - The page does NOT reload
   - The filters are cleared properly
   - Only the ProductGrid re-renders (not the entire page)
   - The console shows background API requests, not full page navigations

## Expected Behavior

- âœ… No page reloads when clearing filters
- âœ… Background API requests using React Query
- âœ… Only ProductGrid section re-renders
- âœ… Smooth filter clearing with visual feedback

## Console Logs to Monitor

Look for these logs when testing:

- `ðŸ”„ Shop handleFiltersChange called:` (filter changes)
- `ðŸŽ£ useProducts hook called with options:` (API calls)
- `ðŸ”„ useProducts API call with params:` (background API requests)
- Render counters from debug components should show only ProductGrid re-rendering

## Previous Issue

Before this fix, clicking "Clear" buttons caused full page reloads because browsers treat buttons without explicit `type="button"` as submit buttons when they're descendants of form elements or when certain DOM events propagate.
