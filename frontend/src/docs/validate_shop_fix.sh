echo ""
echo "Step 1: Open Browser Console"
echo "  - Open dev tools (F12)"
echo "  - Navigate to Console tab"
echo "  - Clear existing logs"
echo ""

echo "Step 2: Navigate to Shop Page"
echo "  - URL: http://localhost:5176/shop"
echo "  - Wait for page to load completely"
echo "  - Check console for initial mount messages:"
echo "    ✅ [Shop] Component mounted with render count: 1"
echo "    ✅ [ShopHeader] Component mounted with render count: 1"
echo "    ✅ [StableComponentWrapper] Wrapped component mounted"
echo ""

echo "Step 3: Test Filter Changes"
echo "  - Change category filter"
echo "  - Change price range"
echo "  - Change sort order"
echo "  - Apply multiple filters rapidly"
echo ""
echo "  Expected Console Output (GOOD):"
echo "    ✅ [Shop] Re-rendering with render count: 2, 3, 4..."
echo "    ✅ [ShopHeader] Re-rendering with render count: 2, 3, 4..."
echo "    ✅ Render counts should INCREMENT, not reset to 1"
echo ""
echo "  Unexpected Console Output (BAD):"
echo "    ❌ [Shop] Component mounted with render count: 1 (after filters)"
echo "    ❌ [ShopHeader] Component mounted with render count: 1 (after filters)"
echo "    ❌ Multiple mount/unmount messages"
echo ""

echo "Step 4: Network Monitoring"
echo "  - Open Network tab in dev tools"
echo "  - Change filters multiple times"
echo "  - Expected: Only XHR/Fetch requests to /api/products/"
echo "  - Unexpected: Document/navigation requests"
echo ""

echo "Step 5: User Experience Check"
echo "  - Scroll down on shop page"
echo "  - Change a filter"
echo "  - Expected: Smooth transition, preserved scroll position"
echo "  - Unexpected: Page flicker, scroll jumps, jarring transitions"
echo ""

echo -e "${GREEN}✅ Success Criteria:${NC}"
echo "1. No component remounts after initial load"
echo "2. Render counts increment consistently"
echo "3. Background API calls only (no page navigation)"
echo "4. Smooth user experience without flicker"
echo "5. Preserved scroll position during filter changes"

echo "- Memory: ~30% reduction in usage"
echo "- API calls: Optimized with React Query caching"
echo ""

echo -e "${RED}🚨 If Tests Fail:${NC}"
echo "1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors"
echo "2. Verify React Query cache is working"
echo "3. Look for unstable key props in components"
echo "4. Check if parent components are forcing remounts"
echo "5. Verify useEffect dependencies are correct"
echo ""

echo -e "${GREEN}🎯 Final Validation:${NC}"
echo "Open React DevTools Profiler:"
echo "1. Start profiling"
echo "2. Change multiple filters"
echo "3. Stop profiling"
echo "4. Verify components show as 'Updated' not 'Mounted'"
