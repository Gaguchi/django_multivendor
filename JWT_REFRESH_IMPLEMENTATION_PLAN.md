# JWT Token Refresh Implementation Plan

## Overview

Upgrade the current token refresh mechanism to use industry-standard practices to prevent unnecessary user logouts and provide seamless user experience.

## Current Issues

1. **Basic refresh logic**: Current implementation lacks sophisticated retry mechanisms
2. **No automatic refresh**: Users must manually trigger refresh or wait for 401 errors
3. **Poor error handling**: Limited differentiation between network errors and auth errors
4. **No token validation**: Limited client-side token validation before making requests
5. **Race conditions**: Multiple refresh attempts can occur simultaneously

## Industry-Standard Solution

### Backend Improvements

1. **Enhanced JWT Settings**

   - Longer access token lifetime (15-30 minutes)
   - Sliding refresh tokens with rotation
   - Blacklist support for security
   - Grace period for token refresh

2. **Improved Token Refresh Endpoint**

   - Better error responses with specific error codes
   - Rate limiting protection
   - Detailed logging for monitoring

3. **Token Validation Middleware**
   - Automatic token validation
   - Graceful error handling

### Frontend Improvements

1. **Proactive Token Management**

   - Automatic refresh before expiration
   - Background refresh scheduling
   - Token validation on app start

2. **Smart Retry Logic**

   - Exponential backoff for failed requests
   - Differentiate between auth and network errors
   - Queue requests during refresh

3. **Race Condition Prevention**

   - Single refresh promise to prevent multiple simultaneous refreshes
   - Request queuing during refresh process

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation for network issues
   - Clear user feedback for auth issues
   - Automatic recovery mechanisms

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Backend Enhancement

- [ ] Update JWT settings with industry best practices
- [ ] Improve token refresh endpoint with better error handling
- [ ] Add token validation middleware
- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging

### Phase 2: Frontend Core Logic

- [ ] Create robust token management service
- [ ] Implement proactive refresh scheduling
- [ ] Add smart retry mechanisms
- [ ] Prevent race conditions

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing

- [ ] Integrate with existing authentication flows
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Create test scenarios for edge cases
- [ ] Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Testing Plan

- [ ] Unit tests for token management
- [ ] Integration tests for auth flows
- [ ] Edge case testing (network failures, invalid tokens, etc.)
- [ ] Performance testing for high-frequency scenarios

## Key Features

### Automatic Token Refresh

- Refresh tokens 5 minutes before expiration
- Background refresh without user interruption
- Fallback to manual refresh on 401 errors

### Smart Error Handling

- Distinguish between temporary network issues and permanent auth failures
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- User-friendly error messages

### Security Enhancements

- Token rotation for enhanced security
- Blacklist support for compromised tokens
- Rate limiting on refresh endpoints

### Performance Optimization

- Minimize unnecessary API calls
- Efficient token validation
- Request queuing during refresh

## Success Metrics

1. **Zero unexpected logouts** due to token expiration
2. **Sub-100ms refresh time** for seamless UX
3. **99%+ success rate** for automatic token refresh
4. **Graceful handling** of all error scenarios
5. **No race conditions** in token refresh process

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Normal Operation**: Tokens refresh automatically before expiration
2. **Network Issues**: Graceful handling of temporary connectivity problems
3. **Invalid Tokens**: Proper cleanup and user redirection to login
4. **High Frequency**: Multiple API calls during refresh process
5. **Edge Cases**: Clock skew, token tampering, server downtime
