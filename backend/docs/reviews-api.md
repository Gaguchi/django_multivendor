3. **User cannot review the same product twice**
4. **Only delivered orders count** towards review eligibility

### Review Permissions

- **Create:** Any authenticated user (following eligibility rules)
- **Read:**
  - Own reviews: Only the review author
  - Product reviews: Any authenticated user
- **Update:** Only the review author
- **Delete:** Only the review author

### Media Handling

- **Images and videos are processed and stored** in Django media files
- **Automatic alt text generation** for accessibility
- **File validation** for size and format
- **Secure file serving** through Django

---

## üí° Notes

- All timestamps are in UTC format
- File uploads require `multipart/form-data` content type
- Review ratings are on a scale of 1-5 (integer values only)
- The system maintains order associations to track purchase history
- Review eligibility is checked in real-time to prevent unauthorized reviews
