# Test Plan for Product Edit Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Category Autofill Issue

**Problem**: Category field doesn't autofill when editing products
**Fix**: Ensured category select values are consistently string type

- Changed option values from `{category.id}` to `{String(category.id)}`
- Added fallback `value={formData.category || ''}` to handle undefined values

### 2. Image Duplication Issue

**Problem**: Images being added instead of replaced during updates
**Fix**: Improved initial image handling in ImageUploadSection

- Enhanced the useEffect that processes initialImages to properly replace existing images
- Added cleanup of old blob URLs when replacing images
- Ensured existing images are not treated as new uploads

## Testing Steps:

### Test Category Autofill:

1. Navigate to Products list
2. Edit an existing product
3. Verify the category dropdown shows the correct selected category
4. Change category and verify it updates correctly

### Test Image Replacement:

1. Edit a product that has existing images
2. Verify existing images are displayed correctly
3. Upload new images and verify they replace (not add to) existing images
4. Save the product and verify no image duplication occurs

## Expected Results:

- Category field should pre-populate with correct value when editing
- Image updates should replace existing images, not duplicate them
- PUT requests should be used for updates (already confirmed working)

## Files Modified:

- `src/pages/products/components/ProductDetailsSection.jsx` - Category field fix
- `src/pages/products/components/ImageUploadSection.jsx` - Image handling fix
