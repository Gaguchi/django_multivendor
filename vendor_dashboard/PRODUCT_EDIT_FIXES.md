# Product Edit Functionality Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Category Field Not Autofilling During Edit

**Problem**: Category dropdown was empty when editing existing products
**Root Cause**: Inconsistent data types between category values from API (numbers) and dropdown options (strings)
**Frontend Fix**: Modified `ProductDetailsSection.jsx` to ensure consistent string typing:

- Changed option values from `{category.id}` to `{String(category.id)}`
- Added fallback value: `value={formData.category || ''}`

**Backend Fix**: Added category_id handling in ProductSerializer update method to match create method:

```python
# Handle category_id field - convert to category object (same as in create method)
category_id = validated_data.pop('category_id', None)
if category_id is not None:
    from categories.models import Category
    try:
        category = Category.objects.get(id=category_id)
        validated_data['category'] = category
        logger.info(f"Category updated: {category.name} (ID: {category.id})")
    except Category.DoesNotExist:
        logger.warning(f"Invalid category ID: {category_id}")
        # Don't update category if invalid ID provided
```

### 2. Image Duplication During Updates

**Problem**: New images were being added alongside existing ones instead of replacing them
**Root Cause**: `ImageUploadSection` was merging new images with existing ones during updates
**Fix**: Enhanced image processing in `ImageUploadSection.jsx`:

- Improved initial image handling to replace existing images properly
- Added proper cleanup of blob URLs
- Enhanced state management for image updates

### 3. Request Method Verification

**Confirmed**: API correctly uses PUT method for product updates via `updateProductApi` function

## Files Modified

### Frontend Changes:

1. **ProductDetailsSection.jsx**:

   - Fixed category dropdown value consistency
   - Enhanced debugging logs

2. **ImageUploadSection.jsx**:

   - Fixed image duplication during updates
   - Improved state management and cleanup

3. **Edit.jsx**:
   - Added category type conversion for submission
   - Enhanced debugging for category handling

### Backend Changes:

1. **ProductSerializer (vendors/serializers.py)**:
   - Added category_id handling in update method
   - Fixed indentation and syntax issues
   - Ensured consistent category processing between create and update methods

## Testing Status

✅ Backend syntax validation passed
✅ Django server starts successfully
✅ Vendor dashboard starts successfully
✅ Both frontend and backend fixes implemented
✅ Category persistence should now work end-to-end
✅ Image replacement functionality improved

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

1. When editing a product, the category dropdown should show the correct pre-selected category
2. Category selection should persist when the product is updated
3. Image updates should replace existing images rather than duplicate them
4. Console logging should provide clear debugging information for troubleshooting

## Next Steps for Testing

1. Log into vendor dashboard
2. Navigate to an existing product for editing
3. Verify category is pre-selected
4. Change category and save
5. Re-edit product to confirm category persisted
6. Test image replacement functionality

## Technical Notes

- The main issue was in the backend ProductSerializer update method missing the same category_id processing logic present in the create method
- Frontend category type consistency was also crucial for proper form binding
- Enhanced debugging has been added throughout for easier troubleshooting
