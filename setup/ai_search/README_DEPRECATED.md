# 🗑️ Legacy AI Search Setup Files

**⚠️ DEPRECATED**: These files have been consolidated into the main setup scripts.

Please use the new consolidated setup scripts instead:

## New Setup Commands

**Linux/Mac:**

```bash
bash setup/setup_ai_search.sh
```

**Windows:**

```cmd
setup\setup_ai_search.bat
```

## Files in this directory

These files are kept for reference but should not be used:

- `setup_copilot_ai.py` - Legacy Python setup (use main script instead)
- `setup_copilot_ai.bat` - Legacy Windows setup (use main script instead)
- `setup_github_token.sh` - Legacy Linux/Mac setup (use main script instead)
- `setup_github_token.bat` - Legacy Windows token setup (use main script instead)

## Migration

If you were using any of these files, simply run the new consolidated setup scripts above. They provide the same functionality with better error handling and user experience.

_These files will be removed in a future version._
