# Review System Implementation Complete

## 🎯 FINAL STATUS: READY FOR TESTING

The review system has been fully implemented and optimized for accurate real-time display of ratings and review counts across both product cards and product pages.

## 🔧 Key Fixes Implemented

### Backend Critical Fix

- **Fixed VendorProduct Model**: Corrected `average_rating` and `review_count` properties to use the correct `reviews` related_name instead of `review_set`
- **Added Review Signals**: Implemented cache invalidation when reviews are created, updated, or deleted
- **Connected Signals**: Ensured signals are properly loaded via apps.py

### Frontend Real-Time Updates

- **Enhanced ReviewContext**: Added React Query integration to invalidate product caches when reviews change
- **Updated Product Page**: Added refresh mechanism to update product data when reviews are submitted
- **Enhanced ProductReviews**: Added callback support to trigger product data refresh
- **Verified ProductCard**: Confirmed it already uses the correct `average_rating` and `review_count` fields

## 🔄 Real-Time Update Flow

```
User submits review → Backend saves review → Signals clear cache →
Frontend invalidates queries → Product lists refresh → ProductCards update →
Product pages refresh → New rating/count displayed
```
