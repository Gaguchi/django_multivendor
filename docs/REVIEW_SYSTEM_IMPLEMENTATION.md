## 🔧 Key Implementation Details

### Backend Validation Logic

```python
def validate(self, data):
    """Validate that user can review this product"""
    user = self.context['request'].user
    product = data.get('product')

    # Check if user has purchased and received this product
    if not OrderItem.objects.filter(
        order__user=user,
        product=product,
        order__status='Delivered'
    ).exists():
        raise serializers.ValidationError(
            "You can only review products from orders that have been delivered."
        )

    # Check if user already reviewed this product (for new reviews)
    if not self.instance and Review.objects.filter(user=user, product=product).exists():
        raise serializers.ValidationError(
            "You have already reviewed this product."
        )

    return data
```

### Frontend File Upload Handling

```javascript
const handleImageChange = (e) => {
  const files = Array.from(e.target.files);
  const maxImages = 5;
  const maxFileSize = 5 * 1024 * 1024; // 5MB

  // Validation logic
  for (const file of files) {
    if (file.size > maxFileSize) {
      setImageError("Each image must be smaller than 5MB");
      return;
    }

    if (!file.type.startsWith("image/")) {
      setImageError("Please select only image files");
      return;
    }
  }

  setImages((prev) => [...prev, ...files]);
};
```

### API Integration

```javascript
const createReview = async (reviewData) => {
  const formData = new FormData();

  // Add basic review data
  formData.append("product", reviewData.product);
  formData.append("rating", reviewData.rating);
  formData.append("comment", reviewData.comment);

  // Add files
  reviewData.images?.forEach((image) => {
    if (image instanceof File) {
      formData.append(`images`, image);
    }
  });

  reviewData.videos?.forEach((video) => {
    if (video instanceof File) {
      formData.append(`videos`, video);
    }
  });

  const response = await api.post("/api/reviews/", formData, {
    headers: { "Content-Type": "multipart/form-data" },
  });

  return response.data;
};
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

### Review Writing Interface

- **Visual feedback**: Star ratings with hover effects
- **File previews**: Thumbnail previews for uploaded media
- **Progress indicators**: Loading states during submission
- **Error handling**: Clear validation messages
- **Responsive design**: Works on mobile and desktop

### Review Display

- **Star ratings**: Visual star display with average ratings
- **Media galleries**: Click-to-expand image/video viewing
- **User information**: Review author and date
- **Filtering**: Future support for rating-based filtering

### Navigation Flow

1. User places order → Order delivered
2. User visits "My Orders" → "Leave Review" button appears
3. User clicks review → Redirected to review form
4. User submits review → Added to "My Reviews" tab
5. Review appears on product page for other customers

## 🔒 Security Features

### Backend Security

- **Authentication required**: All review operations require valid JWT
- **Purchase validation**: Users can only review purchased items
- **Duplicate prevention**: One review per user per product
- **File validation**: Type and size restrictions on uploads
- **SQL injection protection**: Django ORM with parameterized queries

### Frontend Security

- **File type validation**: Client-side file type checking
- **Size limits**: Prevents oversized file uploads
- **XSS prevention**: Proper content sanitization
- **CSRF protection**: Django's built-in CSRF middleware

## 📊 Database Schema

### Review Model

```sql
CREATE TABLE reviews_review (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES vendors_vendorproduct(id),
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES auth_user(id),
    order_id INTEGER REFERENCES orders_order(id),
    rating INTEGER NOT NULL CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5),
    comment TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(user_id, product_id)
);
```

### Review Media Models

```sql
CREATE TABLE reviews_reviewimage (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    review_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES reviews_review(id),
    image VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    alt_text VARCHAR(200),
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE reviews_reviewvideo (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    review_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES reviews_review(id),
    video VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    thumbnail VARCHAR(100),
    duration INTEGER,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```
